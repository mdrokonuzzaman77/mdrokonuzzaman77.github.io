                    <h2>Unlocking Quiet Luxury: Affordable Ways to Elevate Your Home’s Interior Design</h2> 
					<div class="spacer"></div>
                    <p>Quiet luxury in interior design can be defined as “understated sophistication” found in elements used the interior décor.  Initially imperceptible as “luxurious,” these elements show their opulence through closer examination and are distinguished by their impeccable craftsmanship and attention to detail. But you don’t always need to spend big to create that feel of luxury in your space. Here are four tips to make your home look more luxurious:

    Use Marble in your décor: Marble has a luxurious appearance with its smooth texture, elegant veining, and polished finish. It holds significance as it has been used in important buildings, in statues, and in architecture.  Because it is expensive to quarry, marble is also a symbol of wealth and status. Using marble in your décor or design, even if it is simply a small marble bowl on a coffee table, or a beautifully carved bowl to place on a credenza, will add a luxurious feel to your home.

                    <h2>Mid Century Window Treatments</h2> 
					<div class="spacer"></div>
                    <p>As an interior designer specializing in aging-in-place projects, I’ve come to appreciate the timeless beauty and functionality of mid century window treatments. These classic designs not only add a touch of nostalgia to any room but also provide practical solutions for those looking to create a comfortable and accessible living space.
					When working on a recent project for a client in Sacramento, I was thrilled to discover their love for mid century modern design. As we discussed their vision for their home, it became clear that mid century window treatments would be the perfect fit. Not only did they complement the overall aesthetic, but they also offered the flexibility and ease of use that my client required.
Curtains and Drapes

One of the most popular mid century window treatments is curtains and drapes. These classic options offer a simple yet elegant solution for controlling light and privacy. When selecting curtains or drapes for a mid century-inspired room, opt for bold colors and geometric patterns that were prevalent during this design era. Don’t be afraid to mix and match patterns to create a unique and personalized look.

                    <h2>Living Room with Mirror Design</h2> 
					<div class="spacer"></div>
                    <p>As an interior designer in Sacramento, CA, I’ve had the pleasure of working on countless living room projects. One design element that never fails to elevate a space is the incorporation of mirrors. A living room with mirror design can instantly brighten up the room, create the illusion of more space, and add a touch of elegance. In this blog post, I’ll share my experiences and insights on how to effectively use mirrors in your living room design.
					</p>
					<p>
					Reflecting Light and Expanding Space:

One of the primary benefits of a living room with mirror design is its ability to reflect light and make the room feel more spacious. When strategically placed opposite windows or light sources, mirrors can bounce natural light throughout the room, creating a brighter and more inviting atmosphere. This is particularly useful in smaller living rooms or those with limited natural light.

In one of my recent projects, I worked with a client who had a cozy Sacramento bungalow. By incorporating a large, framed mirror on the wall opposite the living room window, we were able to maximize the natural light and create the illusion of a more expansive space. The living room with mirror design instantly transformed the feel of the room, making it more open and airy.

                    <h2>Exploring Bobbin Furniture: Where History, Craft, and Timelessness Intersect</h2> 
					<div class="spacer"></div>
                    <p>What is Bobbin Furniture?

Where has bobbin furniture been hiding all this time?! Though it’s been slowly making its presence known on my interior design radar, it hasn’t been a widely celebrated or discussed style in recent years. Perhaps it doesn’t resonate with everyone and has been labeled as “country” furniture, lacking recognition. I suspect it’s been among the many overlooked yet truly stunning chair designs, often found in antique shops across the country, particularly those crafted from dark wood.

Picture this: a cozy reading nook bathed in soft sunlight, decorated with a quaint bobbin chair that invites you to curl up with your favorite book. Or perhaps a bedroom exuding warmth and elegance, with a majestic bobbin bed serving as the centerpiece, its intricately turned spindles adding a touch of nostalgia to the space. This is the appeal of bobbin furniture—a perfect blend of history, craftsmanship, and timeless appeal. 

 

But what exactly is bobbin furniture, and why has it experienced a resurgence in popularity? The answer lies in the resourcefulness of artisans who saw beauty in the off-cuts of wood produced by sewing bobbin factories. Rather than letting these remnants go to waste, they transformed them into works of art, crafting chairs, beds, cribs, and more adorned with intricately turned spindles reminiscent of sewing bobbins.
